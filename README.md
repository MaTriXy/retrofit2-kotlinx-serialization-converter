# Kotlin Serialization Converter

A Retrofit 2 `Converter.Factory` for [Kotlin serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/).

**DEPRECATED** This has moved into Retrofit as a first-party converter. See [here](https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/trunk/retrofit-converters/kotlinx-serialization) for info.


## Usage

Add a converter factory when building your `Retrofit` instance using the `asConverterFactory`
extension function:

```kotlin
val contentType = "application/json".toMediaType()
val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
    .baseUrl("https://example.com/")
    .addConverterFactory(Json.asConverterFactory(contentType))
    .build()
```

Response body types (e.g., `Call<User>`) and `@Body` types (e.g., `@Body user: User`) will now use
the supplied serializer.

Because Kotlin serialization is so flexible in the types it supports, these converters assume
that they can handle all types. If you are mixing this converter with another, you must add this
instance _last_ to allow the other converters a chance to see their types.
